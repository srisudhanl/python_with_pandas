### First Program: [intro](intro.py)

***

* Prints the directories in `pandas` library.
* Prints the dictionary as `dataframe` in `pandas`.
* Prints the type of variable that consist of `dataFrame` object.
* Prints the `version of pandas`.

### Second Program: [Data_Series](data_series.py)

***

* Prints the series of data using `Series()`.
* Prints the certain value in series using index which is called as `label` in pandas.
* Both `labels` and `values` can be of any data type and can be mapped to any other data type or same.
* So, we can also give `custom labels value` for the series.
* We can convert the `JSON` data as series or interpretable structure using `Series()`.
* When we request for the value of the key in the series, if that is not present within the series, it returns `NaN`
  value.

### Third Program: [Data Frame](data_frame.py)

***

* Prints the DataFrame using `DataFrame()`.
* Prints the certain data from the DataFrame using `loc[<index_value>]` method.
* Prints more than one data from the DataFrame using `loc[<list_of_index_values>]` method.
* Prints the Dataframe with `custom_indexes`.
* Prints the certain data using custom index.
* Prints more than one data from the dataframe using custom_indexes.

### Fourth Program: [Read Data From CSV/JSON](reading_data_from_csv_json.py)

***

* Reads the data from csv file using `.read_csv()`.
* Prints the read_data in dataframe object.
* Prints the read_data in string object.
* Reads the data from JSON file using `.read_json()`.
* Prints the read_data in dataframe object.
* Prints the read_data in string object.
* We can also verify the type using `type()`.
* If file is present in any other location, use file path to read that file.

### Fifth Program: [Brief About read_csv()](breif_read_csv.py)

***

* To know Brief about `read_csv()` refer the program.

### Sixth Program: [Brief About read_json()](breif_read_json.py)

***

* To know Brief about `read_json()` refer the program.
