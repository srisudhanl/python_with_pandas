### First Program: [intro](intro.py)
***
* Prints the directories in `pandas` library.
* Prints the dictionary as `dataframe` in `pandas`.
* Prints the type of variable that consist of `dataFrame` object.
* Prints the `version of pandas`.

### Second Program: [Data_Series](data_series.py)
***
* Prints the series of data using `Series()`.
* Prints the certain value in series using index which is called as `label` in pandas.
* Both `labels` and `values` can be of any data type and can be mapped to any other data type or same.
* So, we can also give `custom labels value` for the series.
* We can convert the `JSON` data as series or interpretable structure using `Series()`.
* When we request for the value of the key in the series, if that is not present within the series, it returns `NaN` value.
